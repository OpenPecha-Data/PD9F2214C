A Surge of Faith

Verses In Praise of Tārā

by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

Oṃ svasti.As white as a water lily,Beautiful and noble in the Snowy Land,Caringly you look upon
sentient beings who areDistressed by the demon of self andExhausted by the torments of
chatter.For you are elegantly attired,Greatly renowned and omnispresent,Having compassion
that is swift.In this moment, O noble Tārā,Just now, carry out your activity, I pray,Keep
us from illness and the like.Liberator, whose complexion resembles a lotus,Magnetize everyone,
including those who oppose us,Nourish us and fulfil our wishes, just like a cow of plenty.O
loving mother who cares for all,Put all forms of evil to flight,Quell every torment
here and now.Reduce unruly forces to dust—Sly, fox-like opponents and harmful influences.Transfer
everyone, including the infirm, to liberation.Until then, do not neglect us even
for an instant.Vanquish every form of agitation and distraction.Wondrous goddess,X-ray-like
in your movement,[1]You travel everywhere high and low,Zestful as a roaming deerAnd stable
as the earth itself—to you I pray:Inspire me with your blessings, O noble Tārā,So that
with the sound of “Ha! Ha! Hūṃ! Hūṃ!”I may realize the unborn, the meaning of A.

Chökyi Lodrö offered this prayer on the fourth day of the fourth month in the Wood Mouse (1924).
